Title and Description

The title should be short but as descriptive as possible to help people understand the project's main objective. The description complements the title: What does the project do, and what is its purpose? What technologies are used in this project? You can also add challenges you faced while creating the project and features you plan to add in the future.

I dare say that the description is the most important part of any README, so dedicate special care to this section ❤️
How to Install and Run the Project

This item doesn't apply to all projects, but if your project is something people need to install and run locally, this is crucial. Here, you should include a detailed step-by-step guide on how to install the project and everything necessary to run the development environment smoothly.
How to Use the Project

Write instructions on how to use your project and add examples of how it has already been used (a great tip is to ask those who already use the project to contribute to this section). It's nice to add visuals, such as screenshots of the project in action and anything else you find interesting and relevant.
How to Contribute

Open-source projects are usually always accepting contributions (after all, that's the main appeal of open source), so it's good to have a contribution guide. If someone wants to contribute, what should they do? Just fork and create a pull request, or do they need to create an issue first? We have a contribution guidelines guide if you need inspiration.
